matter in Southern Amazonia, Water.

These data are the results from the calculations described in the manuscript for measurements taken in the Pedra Alta farm in the municipality of 
Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso, located in southern Amazonia (9°49' S, 55°59 W).

All end variables (_f) are from Forest catchments and (_d) Dam catchments
