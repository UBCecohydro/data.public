Data for Water quality and greenhouse gas fluxes for stormwater detained in a constructed wetland
Journal of Environmental Management

These data include the paramenters used to estimate concentration and fluxes of dissolved greenhouse gases, 
as well as the results from the calculations described in the manuscript for measurements
taken at a constructed wetland designed for stormwater managementlocated at 
the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada (49°15'48.88"N, 123°15'3.00"W)
